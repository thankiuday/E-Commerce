ðŸ”— Redis Implementation
Logged into Upstash to set up Redis for caching and performance optimization.
Login with github account, and created a free database.

What is Redis?
Redis (Remote Dictionary Server) is an open-source, in-memory data structure store primarily used as a cache, database, and message broker. It is designed for high-performance and low-latency operations.

Key Features of Redis:
âœ… In-Memory Storage â€“ Stores data in RAM for super-fast access.
âœ… Key-Value Store â€“ Works like a dictionary with key-value pairs.
âœ… Supports Various Data Structures â€“ Strings, Lists, Sets, Hashes, Streams, etc.
âœ… Persistence Options â€“ Can persist data to disk for durability.
âœ… Distributed & Scalable â€“ Supports clustering for high availability.
âœ… Pub/Sub Messaging â€“ Can be used as a real-time message broker.

Where is Redis Used?
Caching (to speed up database queries)
Session Management (storing user sessions in web apps)
Rate Limiting (controlling API request limits)
Queuing System (background task processing)
Leaderboard Systems (storing ranked data)
Why Use Redis in Your E-commerce Project?
For your MERN Stack E-commerce Store, Redis can help with:
ðŸ”¹ Caching frequently accessed data (e.g., product details)
ðŸ”¹ Reducing database load (by storing session data)
ðŸ”¹ Improving response time (by serving data faster)

Since you're integrating Redis via Upstash, you're using a serverless, managed Redis service, meaning you donâ€™t have to set up or manage the Redis infrastructure manually. ðŸš€
